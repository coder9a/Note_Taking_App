# Note_Taking_App
It is a simple Note Taking App developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here, the user can add notes along with their title, search any notes and delete the notes as well if he/she wants.
I have also used bootstrap for styling the user interface components. Bootstrap is bundled with many components that can be used to provide good user experience and user interactions in a web page like cards, navigation bars, dropdowns, icons, buttons, forms and also sizing options for different DOM elements. In this project, we are using bootstrap components for making the front end of website. After designing the website we got into the logic part using JavaScript.
The App has the following features: 
1. Adding a note
2. Searching any note
3. Deleting a note
